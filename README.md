# Easier Enchanting



## Description

This is a simple mod that modifies the enchanting table in two ways:

1.  The tool tip now always shows every enchantment instead of only one.
2.  Clicking on the book generates a new set of enchantments for the price of 6 lapis lazuli

## Notes

* The Fabric version also requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
* The Forge version is a port of the Fabric version. Even if it worked for me I don't have the most trust into it.

## Recompiling for a new Minecraft version

Since this mod is based on Mixins it will probably break on every update. However unless Mojang changes code around the Enchantment table simply recompiling should be enough to get it working again. 

To do this simply follow these steps:

1. Download and install a [Java Development Kit](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) (JDK) if you don't have one
2. Download the sources from [Github](https://github.com/sidit77/EasierEnchanting)
3. Extract the zip into an empty directory
4. Run the file `update.bat` inside the Fabric folder
5. The compiled .jar file should be in *build/libs*
